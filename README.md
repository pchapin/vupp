The VTC Microprocessor Project (VuPP)
=====================================

This project is a rather grand effort to design (and eventually implement) a simple
microprocessor from the gate level (really using a hardware description language). Currently the
only components of the system are software oriented as described briefly below.

+ Fink. The linker for the VuPP processor (in C++)

+ VAS. The assembler for the VuPP processor (in Perl)
  
+ VM. The virtual machine simulator for the VuPP processor (in Ruby)
  
+ Vocal. The compiler for the vocal language (in C++)

The www folder contains documentation for the project. The z80sim folder contains an older
simulator project for the Zilog Z-80. It is not directly related to VuPP but it is sufficiently
similar that it seemed appropriate to include it here.
